# Overview of web technology

The idea of Web pages has been around since the early 1990's and whilst there have been many additions, the basic principles are still the same.


## Three parts to a web page

Any web pages is made up of three parts

* Content
* Structure
* Style

No matter how simple or complicated a website it, it always has these three things.


### Content

Content is the easiest part of your web page to understand, as it the visible part of the web page.  All the text on the page, the images, video or even sounds are all the content of your web page.

If this is your web page, then its the creative part of building the web page.  Its where you convey your thoughts and ideas with words, images and sound.

When you are looking at someone else's page, the content is the part you are interested in viewing (unless you want to see how someone build a specific page).

> Example: When I go to the BBC website, I want to go and find the latest news.  The news itself is the content of that website.


### Structure

The structure of your web page tells the browser how to organise the content.  So when we write the content of our web page we are able to define the layout of that content when its viewed.

Using Hypertext Markup Language, HTML for short, you can use tags to define structure for the various parts of your content.  Using a `<h1>` tag you could indicate which part of your content is a heading, or using a `<p>` tag you could identify things as a paragraph.

There are a great many tags you can use and you sholdnt try learn them all at once.


### Style

When you create content, it is hopefully of interest to others.  One way to make the content more applealing is to make that content visually appealing.

The structure can give you a good layout of your content, applying styles can make that page visually stunning and more appealing to the viewer.

Common examples of styles you apply to your content include:

* using a specific font family, different font sizes for different parts of your content

Whilst style can be added all within the HTML tags you use to create the structure, most of the style is now defined using Cascading Stylesheets.
